This project addresses the limitation of the original GeminiPro chatbot, which stores all search history and conversations, making it difficult to find important information. To solve this issue, a custom chatbot was developed and hosted on Streamlit.

Why to use this -

No history storage: The chatbot does not store any search history or conversations, ensuring privacy and clutter-free browsing.
Enhanced search functionality: Users can easily search for information on Gemini without worrying about past search results influencing their current search.
Streamlit integration: The chatbot is hosted on Streamlit, providing a user-friendly and interactive interface.
